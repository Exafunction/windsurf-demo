description: Test new changes
---

I just finished making a feature to my game windsurf-demo. To wrap things up, I want to:

1. Stage the changes - so that it's easy to see what new changes have been made since the feature.
2. Write 5 unit tests.
3. Test the code.
4. Fix any issues that appear in step 3. Do NOT change any business logic UNLESS it is actually buggy.
5. Draft a PR.
6. Commit the code.
