description: Create a new dbt data model
---

0. Before creating a new model, ask me clarifying questions about what I am looking for with the model.

1. Once I've added clarification, please create documentation for the model in the schema.yml file in the directory where we will eventually build the model.

2. While you are adding documentation please add dbt tests that you predict will be important to the model.

3. After I have reviewed the proposed documentation and tests in the schema.yml file, I'll likely give feedback.

4. After I have approved the documented columns and tests in the schema.yml THEN Cascade you can go implement the new model.
